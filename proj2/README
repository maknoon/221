PROGRAMMING PROJECT #2

Notes:

  - To run, invoke:
    $ make clean && make && ./main
    Uncomment #DEBUG macro at the top for more verbose logging.
    
  - Sample output file output.txt does not contain verbose logging.
  
  - Helper functions added: print() and bin_print() in max_heap (for 
    debugging purposes), find_word() in string_bst (for use in conjunction
    with implementation of word_frequency()).

  - Referenced some of the code from lecture slide set #3 (Priority Queues)
    to be used in my delete_max & swap_down, insert & swap_up functions,
    specifically the function deleteMin c/o slide #21 of slide set #3.
    
  - Made a small change to util.cpp to include parentheses in the list of tokens
    used by load_bst because it wasn't parsing Kanye lyrics correctly :(
