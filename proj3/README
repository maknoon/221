PROGRAMMING PROJECT #3

Invoke $ make clean && make all or $ make g[#] for each generator.
Code for generator6 was copied from the supplied project document.

Notes:
  generators:
	- generator0 just inserts incremental integers (n)
	- generator1 inserts & immediately finds integers (n/2)
	- generator2 inserts incremental n/2 & removes decremental n/2
	- generator3 inserts incremental n/2 & finds decremental n/2
	- generator4 inserts n/4, then finds in 3 different fashions
	- generator5 inserts decremental integers (n)
	- generator6 inserts & immediately removes integers (n)
	- generator7 inserts halves of n in different orders
	- generator10 is for testing stuff; won't affect leaderboard

  etc:
	- probably spent around 12 hours on this project in total
	- output.sh is a bash script for outputting points to gnuplot
